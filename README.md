# TARGET_BUSINESS_CASE_STUDY
SQL-based E-commerce Insights &amp; Operational Analysis on Target Brazil Orders (2016–2018) using BigQuery

Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end SQL-based analytical case study on Target’s Brazilian
e-commerce operations. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, order trends, delivery
performance, and payment patterns using structured queries on a relational dataset.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple interrelated tables including customers, orders, order_items, and
payments. These tables collectively capture customer demographics, purchase timestamps, freight
costs, delivery timelines, and payment methods.
Key Analysis Performed
• Exploratory Data Analysis: Customer distribution, order time range, and geographic coverage.
• Order Trends: Year-wise and month-wise order growth and seasonality.
• Customer Behavior: Time-of-day analysis for order placement.
• Regional Insights: State-wise order volume and customer distribution.
• Economic Impact: Order value growth, freight costs, and revenue contribution by state.
• Delivery Performance: Actual vs estimated delivery time analysis.
• Payment Analysis: Payment methods usage and installment behavior.
Tools & Technologies
• SQL (Google BigQuery compatible syntax)
• Relational Database Concepts
• Analytical Query Design
Business Insights
The analysis highlights strong year-on-year growth in e-commerce adoption, clear seasonal
purchasing patterns, and significant variation in freight costs and delivery efficiency across states.
Payment analysis indicates heavy reliance on credit cards and installment-based transactions,
reflecting customer affordability behavior.
How to Use This Project
This repository can be used as a reference for SQL analytics interviews, academic submissions,
and real-world business intelligence case studies. Each query is modular and can be adapted to
similar e-commerce datasets.
